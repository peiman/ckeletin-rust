# ckeletin-rust — Project Guide for AI Agents

## About This Project

**ckeletin-rust** is a Rust CLI scaffold implementing the [ckeletin spec](https://github.com/peiman/ckeletin) v0.3.0. It enforces four-layer architecture at compile time through a Cargo workspace with separate crates.

Key characteristics:
- **Workspace with 3 crates:** `domain` (business logic), `infrastructure` (config, logging, output), `cli` (entry + commands)
- **Compile-time architecture enforcement:** Crate boundaries in Cargo.toml prevent reverse dependencies. Violation tests prove it (CKSPEC-ENF-006)
- **Three-stream output:** stdout (data), stderr (status), log file (audit)
- **JSON mode:** `--output json` flag for machine-readable output on every command
- **Shadow logging:** Every output operation logged to audit stream
- **Layered configuration:** defaults → TOML file → environment variables → CLI flags
- **TDD:** Tests first, always. 85% minimum coverage
- **Dependency injection over mocking** — writer injection pattern, no mock frameworks

## Architecture

```
crates/
├── domain/           # Business logic — serde ONLY, no framework deps
│   └── src/
│       ├── lib.rs
│       └── ping.rs   # Example: pure function, returns typed result
├── infrastructure/   # Shared services — NO domain or cli deps
│   └── src/

│       ├── config.rs   # figment layered config
│       ├── logging.rs  # tracing: stderr + file layers
│       └── output.rs   # Envelope, human/JSON rendering, shadow log
└── cli/              # Entry + commands — depends on domain + infrastructure
    └── src/
        ├── main.rs     # Bootstrap only (~20 lines)
        ├── root.rs     # clap derive: Cli struct, Commands enum
        └── ping.rs     # Handler: calls domain, renders via infrastructure
```

**Dependency direction (compile-time enforced):**
- `domain` → serde only. Cannot import clap, figment, tracing, infrastructure.
- `infrastructure` → Cannot import domain or cli.
- `cli` → Imports both domain and infrastructure. Only crate with clap.

**Violation tests:** `crates/domain/tests/architecture_violations.rs` and `crates/infrastructure/tests/architecture_violations.rs` use `trybuild` to verify that violating a boundary produces a compile error.

## Commands

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Run all checks | `just check` |
| Run tests only | `just test` |
| Format code | `just fmt` |
| Check formatting | `just fmt-check` |
| Run clippy | `just clippy` |
| License/advisory check | `just deny` |
| Coverage (85% min) | `just coverage` |
| Build release binary | `just build` |
| Run single crate tests | `cargo test -p ckeletin-domain` |
| Run specific test | `cargo test -p ckeletin-infrastructure --lib output::tests::envelope_success` |

**`just check` is the single gateway.** It runs fmt, clippy, test, deny — the same checks in CI and locally (SSOT). Run it before every commit.

## Adding a New Command

1. **Domain logic** (`crates/domain/src/mycommand.rs`):
   - Pure function, returns a typed result struct
   - `#[derive(Serialize)]` + `impl Display` on the result
   - Unit tests in the same file
   - No framework imports — only `serde` and `std`

2. **CLI handler** (`crates/cli/src/mycommand.rs`):
   - Calls domain function, passes result to `Output::success()`
   - Takes `&Output` as parameter for format selection
   - For a "no-data-to-report" success path (e.g. "no recorded
     history yet", "no pending actions"), call `Output::message()`
     not `Output::success()` with a `&format!("...")` String. The
     helper produces a stable JSON shape (`data: {"message":
     "..."}`) that downstream consumers can rely on; passing a
     bare String to `success` wraps it as a raw string blob in the
     envelope's `data` slot. See `output.rs` for the contract.

3. **Wire into root** (`crates/cli/src/root.rs`):
   - Add variant to `Commands` enum
   - Add match arm in `run_inner()` in `main.rs`

4. **Integration test** (`crates/cli/tests/cli.rs`):
   - Test human mode and JSON mode output

5. **Commit atomically:** Test + implementation in one commit (CKSPEC-TEST-004)

> **Common Mistake: Discovery logic in infrastructure.**
> The natural instinct is to put system discovery (running external processes, querying
> system state) in infrastructure because it uses infrastructure tools like process
> runners. But if that discovery code returns domain types, it creates an
> infrastructure -> domain dependency, violating CKSPEC-ARCH-005. The correct pattern:
> infrastructure provides generic tools (e.g., `process::run_capture`), and the **CLI
> layer** uses those tools to run commands and construct domain types from the results.
> Infrastructure never imports domain.

> **Domain types without business logic is valid.**
> Sometimes a command's domain layer is just typed data structures with
> `#[derive(Serialize)]` + `impl Display` — no computation, no validation, just
> structured output types. That is fine. The "logic" is orchestration in the CLI layer:
> calling infrastructure tools, building domain types from results, and passing them to
> `Output`. Not every domain module needs algorithms; sometimes its value is giving the
> pipeline a typed contract instead of raw strings.

## Coding Conventions

- **Domain has zero framework deps.** If you need logging in domain, return data and let the CLI layer log it.
- **All output through `Output` struct.** Never `println!` or `eprintln!` in domain or infrastructure. The output system handles stream routing and shadow logging.
- **Domain types handed to `Output::success` must implement both `Serialize` and `Display`.** `Output::success<T: Serialize + Display>` renders via `Display` in human mode and serializes via `Serialize` in JSON mode. One value, two outputs — presentation lives on the type. Implementing only `Serialize` means the type doesn't compile into a `success()` call; implementing only `Display` means JSON mode silently renders a string blob. See `crates/cli/src/ping.rs` (minimal) and `workhorse/crates/domain/src/replay.rs` (richer, with nested sections) for worked examples.
- **No-data success paths use `Output::message()`, not `Output::success()` with a `&format!("...")` string.** The `message` helper (added in ckeletin 0.2.2) writes a human sentence in text mode and an envelope with `data: {"message": msg}` in JSON mode — a stable, structured shape instead of a raw string blob.
- **Error envelopes must identify the failing subcommand.** Capture the command name from `&cli.command` *before* moving `cli` into `run_inner`, thread it into `Output::error`. Use an exhaustive `match` (not a default arm) so new subcommands are a compile error until they declare their own name — no silent `"init"` fallback. See `crates/cli/src/main.rs::subcommand_name`.
- **Typed configuration.** Add fields to `Config` struct in `config.rs`. figment deserializes at startup — no runtime type assertions.
- **Error handling:** `thiserror` for typed errors, `Box<dyn Error>` at application boundary.
- **Conventional commits:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:`, `chore:`. Enforced by lefthook commit-msg hook.

## Testing

- **Unit tests:** `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in each source file
- **Violation tests:** `trybuild` compile-fail tests in `crates/*/tests/`
- **Integration tests:** `assert_cmd` in `crates/cli/tests/cli.rs`
- **Coverage:** `just coverage` (85% minimum, CKSPEC-TEST-002)
- **No mock frameworks.** Use writer injection (pass `&mut dyn Write`) or simple test doubles.

## Patterns for data-driven plug points

When a CKSPEC-compliant CLI grows to support **multiple backends,
runtimes, or providers**, the common pattern is a set of `const`s —
one per plugin — all matching the same struct shape (binary name,
signal strings, templates, keywords). This is a powerful pattern
but it has two specific failure modes that earn their own discipline.

### Capture-before-declare

Constants representing external systems (e.g. TUI ready signals,
CLI flag names, API response markers) MUST be picked from captured
evidence of the real system — never from docs, memory, or a
related implementation. External reality drifts; pinned constants
picked from intuition drift silently. The symptom is the pipeline
mis-classifying state weeks after the constant landed, with green
tests the whole time because the tests were written against the
same incorrect values.

**Discipline:** for every new plug-point constant:

1. Launch the real external system under your wrapper.
2. Capture its output/state in every distinct mode
   (pre-ready, ready, post-invocation, completion, failure).
3. Pick constant values from strings that appear *only* in the
   state they identify. Avoid substrings of text that appears in
   adjacent states.
4. Pin the captures as literals in regression tests that assert
   the picked constants appear in the right state and not the
   wrong ones. When the external system changes, these tests fail
   loudly — not silently at runtime.
5. Commit cites the capture source (file path or transcript).

Worked reference implementation:
[workhorse's adapter-authoring protocol](https://github.com/peiman/workhorse/blob/main/workhorse-vault/references/adapter-authoring-protocol.md)
— the history section documents three separate incidents that
earned this discipline before it was written down.

### Cross-plug-point alias tests

When two plug-point constants share a shape, it's easy for one to
accidentally pick a signal that's a substring of another's.
Example: if plugin A declares `ready_signal = "Ready"` and plugin
B declares `completion_signal = "Not ready for input"`, A's signal
false-matches B's pane content.

**Discipline:** add a zero-cost invariant test that, for every
pair of plug-points (A, B) where A ≠ B, asserts no signal in A is
a substring of any signal in B. The test iterates the plug-point
registry, so adding a new plug-point automatically gets guarded
without per-plugin test code.

Worked reference:
[workhorse's `adapter_signals_do_not_alias_across_adapters`](https://github.com/peiman/workhorse/blob/main/crates/domain/src/runtime.rs)
in `crates/domain/src/runtime.rs`.

### When these patterns apply (and when they don't)

These patterns apply when the CLI has multiple pluggable backends
represented as data (constants or config). They don't apply when
the CLI has a single runtime, a single protocol, or pure
business logic. Add them when the second plug-point lands — not
speculatively in a single-plugin CLI.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `just check` fails on fmt | `just fmt` then retry |
| Clippy pedantic warning | Fix it or add targeted `#[allow]` with justification |
| Violation test fails after adding dependency | You probably added a framework dep to domain — remove it |
| `cargo deny check` fails | Check `deny.toml` allowlist or update advisory database |
| Integration test can't find binary | `cargo build` first, or run via `cargo test -p ckeletin-cli` |
